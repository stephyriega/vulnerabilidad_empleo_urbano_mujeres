# Ni una menos en el mercado laboral: la vulnerabilidad del empleo de las mujeres en el Per√∫ urbano del 2019

Abstract
The research analyzes job loss among women in urban areas of Peru in 2020, using data from the ENAHO Panel 2016 - 2018 and a penalized logit model with undersampling confirming its efficiency through the area under the ROC curve. The study focuses on vulnerability to unemployment, highlighting how the precarious labor market disproportionately affects women, influenced by labor segregation and gender norms in household chores. The main objective was to identify women who in 2019 were at risk of losing their jobs in 2020, proposing that more than 18% would be in this situation based on historical trends. The results revealed that more than 30% of women employed in 2019 were at risk. The analysis reveals that the most influential variables in predicting womens job loss are related to their workplaces and household characteristics. Additional robustness tests of the model maintained consistent results, suggesting high vulnerability. The research underscores the need to deepen the study of female employment and explore effective public policies to mitigate impacts in future crises. It is recommended that advanced methodologies be employed for a more complete understanding of labor dynamics and their impact on public policies.
